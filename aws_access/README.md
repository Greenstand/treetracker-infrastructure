### Getting started

You'll need to assume the role of an account that has the permission to talk to the treetracker-infrastructure bucket to run terraform.

Once you have your aws settings configured locally, you should be able to apply changes/ have access to the state bucket.

### What is this for?
This set of terraform sets up any api users and relevant state buckets.
