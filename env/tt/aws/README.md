This is the parent directory of all AWS [cloud computing platform] environments.

Each sub-directory here is a [AWS region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/), with the exception of `global`, which includes environments that are not *region*-specific.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
 - Existing resources exist in the us-east-1 region, but this region is more unstable than others.
   All new resources should be created in the us-east-2 region or a us-west region.
