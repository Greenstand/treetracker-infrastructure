This directory contains environments for AWS region us-east-1.

Each sub-directory is an 'environment', or unit of configuration specific to one or several components/modules/resources, that form a logical unit (an "environment"). This is *configuration only*; all code is kept in a different directory.

Put your configuration in these directories, and configure your deployment tools to refer to them for configuration. You can create Makefiles or other configuration to enable you to run deployment commands from these directories.
